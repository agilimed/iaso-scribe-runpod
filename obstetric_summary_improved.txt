OBSTETRIC CASE SUMMARY - IMPROVED VERSION
==========================================

Clinical Summary

Chief Complaint:
• An 18-year-old G2P0 patient at 35 weeks + 4 days presented with preterm contractions and symptoms (increased pelvic pressure, contractions, vaginal discharge) suggestive of possible rupture of membranes.

Key Findings:
• History: The patient has significant risk factors including past tobacco use (ceased in the second trimester), chronic mild asthma managed with PRN salbutamol, recurrent preterm contractions, limited family support, and a previous spontaneous abortion.
• Prenatal Course: Serial antenatal visits revealed normal fetal growth (EFW in the 35th percentile at week 28) and reactive NSTs. Betamethasone was administered for lung maturity after an episode of uterine irritability, with additional doses given as precautionary measures at weeks 30 and 32.
• Labor/Delivery Admission: At 35+4 weeks, she presented in active labor with confirmed rupture of membranes (positive pooling/nitrazine test), cervical dilation of 5 cm with 70% effacement, and -1 station. Management included IUPC insertion, epidural analgesia, and Pitocin augmentation.
• Delivery: The patient had a spontaneous vaginal delivery with an occiput anterior presentation; the second stage lasted approximately 15 minutes. There were minor perineal lacerations (bilateral superficial labial) and a hymenal remnant excised with a single suture. Placenta delivered intact, and cord gases were sent due to prematurity.
• Neonate: A healthy female infant was born with Apgar scores of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes; she required NICU observation for 24–48 hours.

Diagnosis/Assessment:
• The patient experienced spontaneous preterm labor at 35+4 weeks, resulting in a vaginal delivery of a healthy infant.
• Chronic asthma was well-controlled, and past tobacco use had ceased by the second trimester.
• Psychosocial risk factors (young maternal age and limited support) were noted, warranting further assessment.

Treatment Plan:
Maternal:
 – Monitor for postpartum hemorrhage, infection, and perineal healing.
 – Vital signs every 4 hours; provide lactation support.
 – Pain management with NSAIDs and acetaminophen as needed.
 – Continue iron and calcium supplementation.
 – Consider psychosocial assessment prior to discharge.

Infant:
 – NICU observation for 24–48 hours due to prematurity.
 – Monitor blood glucose and temperature.
 – Conduct routine newborn screening and hearing tests.

Follow-Up Requirements:
• Obstetric follow-up in 1 week for suture check and emotional well-being, with a 6-week postpartum visit.
• Pediatric follow-up is arranged.
