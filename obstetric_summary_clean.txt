OBSTETRIC CASE SUMMARY
======================

Patient is an 18-year-old G2P0 at 35+4 weeks gestation with a history of recurrent preterm contractions and other risk factors (prior spontaneous abortion, past tobacco use [ceased in second trimester], mild asthma, and psychosocial stressors). She presented with increased pelvic pressure, regular contractions, and vaginal discharge suggestive of possible rupture of membranes.

Over the course of her high‐risk antenatal care:
• At week 28, fundal height was reassuring, fetal growth was appropriate (35th percentile), smoking cessation counseled, and a dose of betamethasone was administered for lung maturity.
• By week 30, intermittent dyspnea was managed with PRN salbutamol; fetal nonstress testing (NST) was reactive and cervical length measured by ultrasound was normal.
• At week 32 she experienced regular contractions with minimal cervical change (1 cm dilation, 50% effacement); a negative fetal fibronectin test led to initiation of bedrest at home.
• By week 34, contractions intensified (cervix 2 cm dilated, 60% effaced) and discussion about preterm labor risks was provided.

At delivery admission (35+4 weeks), she arrived in active labor with:
• Confirmed rupture of membranes (positive pooling/nitrazine test),
• Cervical dilation of 5 cm with 70% effacement,
• An IUPC placed to monitor contractions, and
• Management with epidural anesthesia and Pitocin augmentation.

Delivery was achieved spontaneously via vaginal route in occiput anterior position. The second stage lasted about 15 minutes; no episiotomy was required though bilateral superficial labial lacerations were noted (and a small hymenal remnant excised with one suture). The placenta was delivered intact, and estimated blood loss was 300 mL.

The newborn is female with Apgars of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes; she exhibited a vigorous cry and appropriate initial exam but was transferred to the neonatal care team for observation due to her late-preterm status.

Assessment:
• Spontaneous preterm labor at 35+4 weeks resulting in an uncomplicated vaginal delivery of a healthy infant.
• History of tobacco use (ceased early second trimester) with no evidence of intrauterine growth restriction.
• Chronic, mild asthma that remained well-controlled throughout pregnancy and labor.
• Previous spontaneous abortion did not impact the current outcome.
• Psychosocial risk factors noted (young maternal age and limited family support).

Plan:
Maternal Care:
• Monitor for postpartum hemorrhage, infection, and perineal healing; vital signs every 4 hours.
• Provide lactation support and consider a psychosocial assessment before discharge.
• Pain management using NSAIDs and acetaminophen as needed.
• Continue iron and calcium supplementation.

Infant Care:
• Admission to the NICU for observation (24–48 hours) due to prematurity; monitor blood glucose and temperature.
• Conduct routine newborn screening and hearing test.

Follow-up:
• Obstetric follow-up in 1 week for suture check and evaluation of emotional well-being, with a subsequent 6-week postpartum visit.
• Pediatric follow-up has been arranged.
