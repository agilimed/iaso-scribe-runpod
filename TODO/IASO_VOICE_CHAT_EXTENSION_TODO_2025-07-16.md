```

### Key Components:
- **Amazon Connect**: Phone system infrastructure (handles calls)
- **Whisper**: Speech-to-Text (already deployed on RunPod)
- **RASA**: Dialog management and conversation flow (replaces Lex V2)
- **Clinical AI**: Medical logic and entity extraction
- **Amazon Polly**: Text-to-Speech with empathetic voices
- **IasoVoice Orchestrator**: Coordinates all components

### Why RASA Instead of Lex V2:
1. **Medical Complexity**: RASA handles complex multi-turn medical conversations better
2. **Clinical Integration**: Easier to integrate with existing Clinical AI services
3. **Privacy**: Self-hosted solution keeps all data within HIPAA infrastructure
4. **Customization**: Full control over dialog flows and medical protocols
5. **Custom Actions**: Can trigger SOAP notes, alerts, appointments directly
6. **Training Data**: Can use real medical conversations for training

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (This Week):

### 1. Production Testing & Integration (Priority 1) ‚úÖ NEW
- [x] Test MCP servers with actual RunPod endpoints
- [ ] Update orchestrator to make real HTTP calls to MCP servers
- [ ] Test complete workflow: audio ‚Üí transcription ‚Üí SOAP note
- [ ] Verify tag-based separation in production
- [ ] Create integration tests for all MCP tools

### 2. IasoVoice Architecture Planning (Priority 2) üöÄ NEXT
- [ ] Design IasoVoice Orchestrator service architecture
- [ ] Plan RASA deployment strategy (Kubernetes specs)
- [ ] Define conversation flows for medical use cases
- [ ] Create audio streaming pipeline design
- [ ] Document integration points with existing services

### 3. AWS Infrastructure Setup (Priority 3)
- [ ] Create Amazon Connect instance
- [ ] Configure phone numbers and routing
- [ ] Set up Amazon Polly with neural voices
- [ ] Create IAM roles and permissions

## Achievements This Week:
- ‚úÖ Deployed Whisper and Phi-4 on RunPod
- ‚úÖ Created MCP architecture for service coordination
- ‚úÖ Implemented tag-based reasoning separation
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation
