The instructions: Provide a brief clinical summary including:\n- Chief complaint\n- Key findings\n- Diagnosis/Assessment\n- Treatment plan\n- Follow-up requirements.\n\nI must produce a concise summary that is complete, but not too lengthy. Let's see. I'll create a summary with bullet points or paragraphs. The answer should include: \"Chief complaint: preterm contractions at 35 weeks + 4 days.\" Key findings: \"History of tobacco use (ceased in second trimester), chronic asthma, recurrent preterm contractions, limited family support, history of spontaneous abortion; increased pelvic pressure, contractions, vaginal discharge suggestive of ROM; ultrasound details etc.\" I'm to include diagnosis: G2P0 at 35+4 weeks with spontaneous preterm labor. Also mention that the patient delivered a healthy female infant via spontaneous vaginal delivery, with no maternal or neonatal complications post-delivery.\n\nI must also include treatment plan: The patient had betamethasone given for fetal lung maturity; bedrest at home; monitoring of contractions; IUPC insertion during active labor; epidural pain relief and Pitocin augmentation; etc. And follow-up: OB follow up in 1 week, pediatric follow up arranged, NICU observation for 24-48 hours, etc.\n\nI must also include plan details for both maternal and infant.
