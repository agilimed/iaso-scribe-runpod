We'll produce text.\n\nLet's produce summary:\n\nChief Complaint: Preterm contractions at 35+4 weeks gestation with history of complications (prior spontaneous abortion, tobacco use, asthma, psychosocial stressors) and possible ROM symptoms.\n\nKey Findings:\n- The patient is G2P0 at 35+4 weeks, had recurrent preterm contractions and risk factors including tobacco (stopped early second trimester), chronic mild persistent asthma controlled with salbutamol PRN, previous spontaneous abortion.\n- Prenatal course: Fetal growth appropriate; betamethasone administered twice for lung maturity due to uterine irritability episodes. At week 34, contractions intensified and cervix was 2 cm dilated, 60% effaced with bedrest advised.\n- Presentation at delivery admission: active labor with positive ROM, IUPC confirmed contraction frequency and intensity; epidural placement for pain relief, Pitocin augmentation used.\n- Delivery details: spontaneous vaginal delivery of a female infant in occiput anterior position, minimal maternal complications (episiotomy not required, small bilateral labial lacerations, hymenal remnant excised with suture), intact placenta delivered, estimated blood loss 300 mL; cord gases sent due to prematurity.\n- Infant details: Apgars of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively, vigorous cry, transferred to neonatal care team for observation because of late-preterm status.\n\nDiagnosis/Assessment:\n- Spontaneous preterm labor at 35+4 weeks delivered healthy female infant with no maternal or neonatal complications.\n- Tobacco use in pregnancy (history) but cessation achieved by second trimester; no IUGR.\n- Chronic asthma controlled, no exacerbation noted.\n- History of spontaneous abortion did not affect outcome.\n- Psychosocial risk factors present (young age, limited support).\n\nTreatment Plan:\nMaternal: Monitor postpartum hemorrhage, infection, perineal healing. Vital signs q4h; lactation support; possible psychosocial assessment; pain management with NSAIDs and acetaminophen; iron and calcium supplements.\nInfant: Observation in NICU for 24-48 hours due to prematurity; monitor blood glucose and temperature; routine newborn screening and hearing test.\n\nFollow-up:\n- OB follow-up in one week for suture check and emotional well-being evaluation, then 6-week postpartum check.\n- Pediatric follow-up arranged.\n\nI'll produce answer. We'll produce summary with bullet points if possible.\n\nLet's produce answer. I'll produce answer in plain text. I'll produce summary. We'll produce answer as a clinical note: \"Clinical Summary\" etc.\n\nI'll produce answer accordingly.\n\nI'll produce final answer below.Patient is an 18-year-old G2P0 at 35+4 weeks gestation with a history of recurrent preterm contractions and other risk factors (prior spontaneous abortion, past tobacco use [ceased in second trimester], mild asthma, and psychosocial stressors). She presented with increased pelvic pressure, regular contractions, and vaginal discharge suggestive of possible rupture of membranes.\n\nOver the course of her high\u2010risk antenatal care:\n\u2022 At week 28, fundal height was reassuring, fetal growth was appropriate (35th percentile), smoking cessation counseled, and a dose of betamethasone was administered for lung maturity.\n\u2022 By week 30, intermittent dyspnea was managed with PRN salbutamol; fetal nonstress testing (NST) was reactive and cervical length measured by ultrasound was normal.\n\u2022 At week 32 she experienced regular contractions with minimal cervical change (1 cm dilation, 50% effacement); a negative fetal fibronectin test led to initiation of bedrest at home.\n\u2022 By week 34, contractions intensified (cervix 2 cm dilated, 60% effaced) and discussion about preterm labor risks was provided.\n\nAt delivery admission (35+4 weeks), she arrived in active labor with:\n\u2022 Confirmed rupture of membranes (positive pooling/nitrazine test),\n\u2022 Cervical dilation of 5 cm with 70% effacement,\n\u2022 An IUPC placed to monitor contractions, and\n\u2022 Management with epidural anesthesia and Pitocin augmentation.\n\nDelivery was achieved spontaneously via vaginal route in occiput anterior position. The second stage lasted about 15 minutes; no episiotomy was required though bilateral superficial labial lacerations were noted (and a small hymenal remnant excised with one suture). The placenta was delivered intact, and estimated blood loss was 300 mL.\n\nThe newborn is female with Apgars of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes; she exhibited a vigorous cry and appropriate initial exam but was transferred to the neonatal care team for observation due to her late-preterm status.\n\nAssessment:\n\u2022 Spontaneous preterm labor at 35+4 weeks resulting in an uncomplicated vaginal delivery of a healthy infant.\n\u2022 History of tobacco use (ceased early second trimester) with no evidence of intrauterine growth restriction.\n\u2022 Chronic, mild asthma that remained well-controlled throughout pregnancy and labor.\n\u2022 Previous spontaneous abortion did not impact the current outcome.\n\u2022 Psychosocial risk factors noted (young maternal age and limited family support).\n\nPlan:\nMaternal Care:\n\u2022 Monitor for postpartum hemorrhage, infection, and perineal healing; vital signs every 4 hours.\n\u2022 Provide lactation support and consider a psychosocial assessment before discharge.\n\u2022 Pain management using NSAIDs and acetaminophen as needed.\n\u2022 Continue iron and calcium supplementation.\n\nInfant Care:\n\u2022 Admission to the NICU for observation (24\u201348 hours) due to prematurity; monitor blood glucose and temperature.\n\u2022 Conduct routine newborn screening and hearing test.\n\nFollow-up:\n\u2022 Obstetric follow-up in 1 week for suture check and evaluation of emotional well-being, with a subsequent 6-week postpartum visit.\n\u2022 Pediatric follow-up has been arranged.\n\nThis concise summary captures the chief complaint, key findings, diagnosis/assessment, treatment plan, and follow-up requirements for this encounter.",
