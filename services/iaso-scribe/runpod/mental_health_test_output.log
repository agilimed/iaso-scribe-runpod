üìÑ MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION SUMMARY:
================================================================================
We are to answer: "Create a comprehensive clinical summary of this mental health consultation in approximately 750 words. Focus on the critical clinical information while maintaining all important details." But then we have additional instructions from the conversation that says "Structure your response as a flowing narrative that includes:
- Patient demographics and presentation
- Psychiatric and substance use history
- Current episode and precipitating factors
- Mental status examination findings
- Risk assessment
- Comprehensive treatment plan
- Disposition recommendations

Maintain clinical accuracy and use exact terminology from the source."

Now then we have additional instructions: "Please provide:
1. Chief complaint and key symptoms
2. Medical findings and observations
3. Relevant medications with dosages
4. Clinical assessment and diagnosis considerations
5. Recommended follow-up actions
6. Any urgent concerns or red flags

Use clear medical terminology and reasoning."

Thus the answer should incorporate all these elements. We need to produce a clinical summary of the mental health consultation, in about 750 words (but we can aim at approx. that word count). It should be a flowing narrative with bullet points? But instructions are "flowing narrative" so I'll produce a structured text.

I must include key details: demographics: male, age 40, admitted after intentional benzodiazepine and alcohol overdose. History includes treatment-resistant MDD, GAD and chronic alcohol use disorder; recent suicide attempt; worsened symptoms over past six months etc.

I need to mention that the patient was in a mixed substance overdose (40 mg diazepam and 750 mL vodka) but stable now. I'll include details: physical exam: disheveled appearance, mild psychomotor retardation, flat affect, mood empty/ashamed; coherent speech, linear thought process, no AH/VH.

I need to mention risk factors: poor insight, etc. I must mention that there is a history of two previous psychiatric hospitalizations and family history with father died by suicide.

Plan: Transfer to inpatient psychiatry unit after medical clearance, restart escitalopram 10 mg daily, mirtazapine 15 mg nightly, no benzodiazepines due to overdose risk; safety measures include continuous observation and removal of self-harm means; consult addiction services for alcohol detox planning; social work involvement for housing insecurity/disability documentation; psychotherapy reintroduction, DBT-based programming.

I must include the clinical summary with key details. I'll produce a text narrative in about 750 words. It should be structured as requested: including patient demographics and presentation, psychiatric and substance use history, current episode and precipitating factors, mental status exam findings, risk assessment, treatment plan, disposition recommendations. And then also provide bullet items for the additional instructions.

I must include the chief complaint "I'm feeling hopeless, I don't want to be here." The key symptoms: anhedonia, worthlessness, guilt, poor appetite, weight loss, insomnia and passive suicidal ideation that escalated to active thoughts prior to the overdose.

Medical findings: patient had an intentional benzodiazepine and alcohol overdose (40 mg diazepam, 750 mL vodka), no seizures or trauma; intubated then extubated with no neurologic deficits. Also note physical comorbidities: hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, GERD, obstructive sleep apnoea noncompliant with CPAP.

Substance use history: daily alcohol (6-8 drinks/day) since 2019, worsened after job loss in 2023; no tobacco or illicit drugs now; cannabis heavy past but quit early thirties.

Mental status examination details: disheveled appearance, mild psychomotor retardation, flat affect, mood of "empty/ashamed", low-volume slow speech, linear thought process, passive suicidal ideation without plan, denies hallucinations, alert oriented.

Risk assessment: high suicide risk with recent active suicidal thoughts, poor social support, functional impairment, previous hospitalizations for suicidality; family history including father died by suicide. Also alcohol use disorder contributing to impulsivity and mood instability.

Medications: restart escitalopram 10 mg daily (antidepressant), mirtazapine 15 mg nightly (for depression and insomnia) and avoid benzodiazepines due to risk of overdose; may consider ECT or ketamine if no improvement. Also mention potential candidate for inpatient psychiatry transfer, possible ECT evaluation.

Follow-up actions: recommended transfer to inpatient psychiatry unit once medically cleared, initiate suicide risk assessments every shift, consult addiction services for alcohol detox planning and long-term recovery options (discuss naltrexone vs acamprosate post-discharge), social work involvement to address housing insecurity/income, disability documentation; reintroduce structured therapy when stable, explore trauma history with DBT-based programming.

Urgent concerns: high suicide risk, active suicidal ideation in a patient with severe depression and substance use disorder, potential for relapse due to poor insight and nonadherence to outpatient care, social instability, eviction risk.

I must mention that the summary is approximately 750 words. I'll produce text narrative of about 750 words. I can try to produce around 700-750 words.

We need to include "Exact terminology from the source" such as "treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder", "chronic alcohol use disorder", "passive suicidal ideation", etc.

I must be careful not to reveal personal info like patient name and MRN. But I'll produce a text summary.

I'll produce my answer in plain text with no markdown formatting. Also instructions says: "Maintain clinical accuracy and use exact terminology from the source."

I need to include items:
- Chief complaint and key symptoms
- Medical findings and observations
- Relevant medications with dosages
- Clinical assessment and diagnosis considerations
- Recommended follow-up actions
- Urgent concerns or red flags.

I'll produce answer as a flowing narrative summary that is comprehensive and includes all details. I can structure it in paragraphs, but also include bullet items if needed for clarity. However instructions says "flowing narrative".

I'll produce something like:

"Patient Demographics & Presentation:
A 40-year-old male with known history of treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and chronic alcohol use disorder was admitted to the inpatient medicine ward after an intentional mixed overdose. He presented with chief complaint 'I'm feeling hopeless, I don't want to be here.' ..."

Then I'll include details of his history of present illness: Worsening depressive symptoms over past six months, including anhedonia, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, weight loss, insomnia, passive suicidal ideation that escalated recently.

Include overdose details: ingested approximately 40 mg diazepam and consumed a 750 mL bottle of vodka, found unresponsive but breathing, intubated then extubated with no neurological deficits.

I'll mention his psychiatric history: First diagnosed in his 20s, multiple medication trials including SSRIs, SNRIs, augmentation with aripiprazole; previous hospitalizations for suicidality (2016 and 2022); not engaged in outpatient therapy currently; denies auditory/visual hallucinations.

Substance use details: daily alcohol consumption ~6‚Äì8 drinks/day since 2019, wors
