CARDIOLOGY CONSULTATION SUMMARY
===============================
Generated: 2025-07-17

Patient: 72-year-old male
Consultation Date: July 17, 2025
Consulting: Dr. A. Sharma (Cardiology Fellow)
Referring: Dr. L. Chen (Internal Medicine)

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
New-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION:
This 72-year-old male with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, stage III chronic kidney disease, and a former heavy smoker) was admitted for community‐acquired pneumonia and treated initially with IV Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin. He had been clinically stable until this evening when he developed new-onset palpitations, severe lightheadedness, and worsening dyspnea without chest pain.

On evaluation at about 7:00 PM, the primary team noted that his heart rate was in the 140s–150s beats per minute and his blood pressure had dropped from a previously stable 130/80 mmHg to 95/60 mmHg. An urgent EKG confirmed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) at a ventricular rate of 145 bpm, with no acute ST-segment changes but meeting voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy and a normal QTc interval.

KEY INVESTIGATIONS:
• Labs from this evening showed: 
 – CBC: WBC 14.5 K/uL (elevated), Hgb 12.8 g/dL, Platelets 220 K/uL
 – BMP: Na 137 mmol/L, K 3.6 mmol/L, Cl 101 mmol/L, CO2 22 mmol/L, BUN 35 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.7 mg/dL (up from baseline 1.6 mg/dL), Glucose 188 mg/dL
 – Cardiac enzymes: High-sensitivity troponin I at 0.08 ng/mL (reference <0.04 ng/mL) with a repeat ordered
 – BNP was elevated at 850 pg/mL
• TSH was normal at 1.8 mIU/L
• Chest X-Ray confirmed right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia, with no overt pulmonary edema
• A bedside limited transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) estimated the left ventricular ejection fraction at 45–50% (mildly reduced), noted moderate left atrial dilation, mild mitral regurgitation, and no significant valvular stenosis or pericardial effusion

ASSESSMENT:
1. New-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely precipitated by sepsis secondary to pneumonia
2. Demand ischemia (type 2 myocardial infarction pattern) suggested by a low-level troponin rise in the setting of extreme tachycardia, fever, and hypoxemia—without evidence for acute coronary syndrome
3. Acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation evidenced by dyspnea, elevated jugular venous pressure (8 cm H2O), high BNP, and a newly apparent mildly reduced ejection fraction in a patient with long-standing hypertension
4. Underlying community-acquired pneumonia driving the systemic inflammatory response

TREATMENT PLAN:
• Rate Control: IV Metoprolol 5 mg slow push, repeatable twice every 10 minutes as tolerated while closely monitoring blood pressure; target heart rate below 110 bpm initially. Calcium channel blockers avoided due to negative inotropic effects
• Anticoagulation: Given high stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score = 4) and HAS-BLED Score of 2, therapeutic anticoagulation initiated immediately using Apixaban (Eliquis) 5 mg twice daily
• Heart Failure Management: Gentle diuresis planned once blood pressure stabilizes; Lasix 20 mg IV administered with monitoring of urine output and renal function. Strict I/O monitoring and daily weights
• Ischemia Management: No urgent coronary angiography indicated. Troponins trended every 6 hours x2 while optimizing oxygenation and continuing antibiotic therapy

FOLLOW-UP:
• Electrolyte repletion: Target potassium >4.0 mEq/L and magnesium >2.0 mg/dL
• Transition to oral rate control agents once hemodynamically stable
• Formal comprehensive TTE recommended after resolution of acute infectious process
• Continued collaborative care between Cardiology and Internal Medicine
